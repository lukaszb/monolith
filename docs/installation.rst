Installation
============

``monolith`` runs on Python 2.6+/3.X. In order to install it simply use
``easy_install``::

    easy_install monolith

or ``pip``::

    pip install monolith


.. note::
   As Python 2.6 was not yet shipped with ``argparse`` package, *distutils*
   would install it if installation is run under older Python version.
